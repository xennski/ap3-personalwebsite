<h2>Why is he my favorite character?</h2>
        <p>There are multiple reasons why I LOVE Harumasa Asaba. First, his design. Although some people might find it plain, I favor it.
            In my opinion, he looks INCREDIBLY cool! He uses two katanas in combat, but they can combine to turn into his main weapon, a bow!
            His design compliments his character, backstory, and occupation well, since he works in a company, where he spends a lot of time 
            in the office doing the thing he hates most- paperwork. Now, let's talk about his personality, the thing I love most! He's quite
            the laidback, outgoing but secretly a genius guy who ignores his work and sleeps in the office, but he can actually push himself hard when it comes to doing work 
            on-field. He's got great humour, and I find his flirty nature interesting. His voice actor also plays a role in this as he voices
            Harumasa really well. There is a lot of energy, emotion, and dramatics in his voice. Not only that, but despite everything he's 
            gone through, he continues to stay as a kind person, helping others as much as he can, and I find that to be one of my favorite traits of his. 
            Finally, the thing that piqued my interest most- his backstory. I won't dive into much detail, but his backstory is extremely heartbreaking. To
            summarize, he was born with a condition called "Ether Aptitude Regression Syndrome," where it mostly affects his lung and hear. His parents basically abandoned him
            after taking him to a hospital and ever since then he was raised by his a doctor in which he calls his "master." He learned everything from his master.
            Now, he's still aking medications and having check-ups for the sake of not making his condition worse. (I really hope he doesn't..)
